# hybrid-drift-model
This repository is created for a technical paper published on Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics entitled "hybrid surrogate model combining physics and data for seismic drift estimation of shear-wall structures". 
The proposed hybrid surrogate model (including the trained GNN model) is deployed on an online server and an application programming interface (API) is developed to facilitate its application. 
The API, necessary document, and some data for demonstration can be found here after the paper is published.
